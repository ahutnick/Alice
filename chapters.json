No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming. “There's plenty of room!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p><p>“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p>",

He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.</p<p>“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some severity; “it's very rude.”</p><p>The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”</p><p>“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I'm glad they've begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.</p><p>“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said the March Hare.</p><p>“Exactly so,” said Alice.</p><p>“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.</p><p>“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that's the same thing, you know.”</p>"
